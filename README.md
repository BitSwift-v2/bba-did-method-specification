# bba-did-method-specification

A DID method based on the Ardor blockchain.

This repository contains the `bba` DID method specification. It uses the Ardor blockchain as a decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) to create and manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A DID is a self controlled persistent identifier and is resolvable to a DID Document. A DID Document contains public available informations (usually in the form of public keys and service endpoints for further interaction) associated to a DID representing entity. Because these informations are cryptographically bound to a DID, a DID controller can use these informations for authentication, assertions and/or proofs of personal identifiable informations (PII). PIIs are usually not stored inside DID Documents, but embedded into Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs and DIDs are the pillars of self-sovereign identity (SSI).

A DID is a self-controlled persistent identifier and can be resolved into a DID document. A DID document contains publicly available information (usually in the form of public keys and service endpoints for further interaction) associated with a DID-representing entity.

The `bba` DID method was added to the official DID method register.
