# bba-did-method-specification

A DID method based on the Ardor blockchain.

This repository contains the `bba` DID method specification. It uses the Ardor blockchain as a decentralized public-key infrastructure (DPKI) for creating and managing decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A DID is a self-controlled persistent identifier and can be resolved into a DID Document. A DID document contains publicly available information (usually in the form of public keys and service endpoints for further interaction) associated with a DID-representing entity. Because this information is cryptographically linked to a DID, a DID controller may use it for authentication, assertion and/or proof of personally identifiable information (PII). PIIs are generally not stored in DID documents but are embedded in Verifiable Credentials (VCs). VCs and DIDs are the pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).

The `bba` DID method is listed in the official DID method registry.
